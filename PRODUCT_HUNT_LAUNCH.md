👋 Hey Product Hunt! I'm [Your Name], maker of Brain Inspired Network.

🤖 What is BIN?
BIN is a marketplace where you can buy ready-made automation bots or sell your own. Think of it as the "App Store for automation bots."

💡 Why I built this:
I noticed developers were building amazing automation bots but had nowhere to sell them. Meanwhile, businesses needed automation but didn't want to hire developers. BIN bridges this gap.

🎯 Key Features:
• 95% revenue share for developers (lowest in the industry!)
• 8 categories: AI, Social Media, Business, E-commerce, Data Scraping, Marketing, Gaming, Finance
# ...existing code...
• Built-in chat between buyers and sellers
• Reviews and ratings system

🚀 What makes us different:
Most marketplaces take 20-30% commission. We only take 5% because we believe in empowering developers.

🎁 Product Hunt Special:
First 100 developers who sign up get featured listing for free! (Worth $50)

🙏 I'd love your feedback:
• What features would you like to see?
• What bots would you buy/sell?
• Any questions about the platform?

Thanks for checking us out! 🚀
